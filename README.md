FruitFall Fiesta is my first project after taking an Intro to CS class. Players navigate a cart to catch falling fruits, each catch or miss altering the score and game speed. It combines strategy, speed, and fun, set against a backdrop of high-definition, cheerful visuals. Inspired by my learning journey, this game showcases my creativity that aims to provide an enjoyable and challenging experience for players. I'm excited about the potential for further development, including the introduction of special fruits that offer score boosts, making the gameplay even more engaging.
